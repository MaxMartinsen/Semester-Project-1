### Description

This project was a school assignment where you had to create a blog site. The design and topics covered in the vibrona blog are at the discretion of the developer, but it must have at least the following pages:
-	Home page
-	About page
-	List of blog posts
-	Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.

### Home Page
The homepage has a "Latest Posts" section that uses a carousel (slider) that users can click on to view more posts. For example, by default, the user can see four messages, then they can click the arrow on the right to view the next four messages, and click it again to view the next four messages. The user can also click back to see the results they have seen before.

### Blog Page

The blog posts page displays the first 10 blogs and the user clicks to view additional results, which are then displayed below the first 10 blogs.

### Blog Specific Page

The content of a particular blog page is dynamically generated using a query string parameter based on any link the user has clicked. The title of a specific blog page based on the blog.

When an image is clicked on a blog post page, a modal window will appear giving the user a larger view of that image. Clicking outside of the image should hide the modal.

### Contact page

Contact page, this page has 4 text fields.
-	Name (More than 5 characters long)
-	Email address (Valid email address)
-	Subject (More than 15 characters long)
-	Message content (More than 25 characters long)

Used by JavaScript for validation, showing error messages if the values in the text fields do not match the requirements.

### WordPress
